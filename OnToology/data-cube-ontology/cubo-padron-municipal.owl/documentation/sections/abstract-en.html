<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The purpose of this vocabulary is to provide definitions of the different structures of the data cubes of census of inhabitants. For that reason, the vocabulary [W3C Data Cube](<http://purl.org/linked-data/cube>) is reused, and instances for each structure have been generated with the objective of showing the dimensions and measures used in each one of the cubes.

Addtionally, other vocabularies and code lists are reused to show the description of the population's details.
