<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The purpose of this vocabulary is to provide the definitions of the different cubes' structure of the municipal census. For that reason, the vocabulary [W3C Data Cube](<http://purl.org/linked-data/cube>) is reused, and the instances for each structure have been generated with the objective of showing the dimensions and measures used in each one of the cubes.

Addtionally, other vocabularies and code lists are reused to show the description of the population's details.
